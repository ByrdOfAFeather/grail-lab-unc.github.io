- title: "CLUES: A Benchmark for Learning Classifiers using Natural Language Explanation"

  description: Supervised learning has traditionally focused on inductive learning by observing labeled examples of a task. In contrast, humans have the ability to learn new concepts from language. Here, we explore learning zero-shot classifiers for structured data purely from language from natural language explanations as supervision. For this, we introduce CLUES, a benchmark consisting of a range of classification tasks over structured data along with natural language supervision in the form of explanations.
