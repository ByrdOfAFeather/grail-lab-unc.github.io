- title: "CLUES: A Benchmark for Learning Classifiers using Natural Language Explanations"
  image: clues.jpg
  description: Supervised learning has traditionally focused on inductive learning by observing labeled examples of a task. In contrast, humans have the ability to learn new concepts from language. Here, we explore learning zero-shot classifiers for structured data purely from language from natural language explanations as supervision. For this, we introduce CLUES, a benchmark consisting of a range of classification tasks over structured data along with natural language supervision in the form of explanations.

- title: "Improving and Simplifying Pattern Exploiting Training"
  image: adapet.jpg
  description: Pattern Exploiting Training (PET) is a recent approach that leverages patterns for few-shot learning. However, PET uses task-specific unlabeled data. In this paper, we focus on few shot learning without any unlabeled data and introduce ADAPET, which modifies PETâ€™s objective to provide denser supervision during fine-tuning. As a result, ADAPET outperforms PET on SuperGLUE without any task-specific unlabeled data.
