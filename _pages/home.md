We are a dynamic research group at [UNC Chapel Hill](http://unc.edu/) led by [Prof. Shashank Srivastava](https://www.ssriva.com/). Our research lies in the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing with special interests in grounding language in perception, neuro-symbolic methods, and interactive machine learning. We are also a part of the larger [UNC-NLP](https://nlp.cs.unc.edu/) group at [UNC CS](https://cs.unc.edu/).
